# Keep-Track-of-the-Pack

Overview:

Keep Track of the Pack is a device coded in C++ that monitors and counts the number of people inside a building. The goal is to improve safety by giving real-time occupancy data that can be used in emergencies such as fires or evacuations.


Purpose:

In emergency situations, first responders often lack accurate information about how many people remain inside. This project provides a low-cost, reliable solution using sensors and an Arduino microcontroller to keep track of occupancy.


Materials Used:

- Arduino Microcontroller
- 2 sets of Laser Transmitters and Sensors
- LCD Display


How It Works:
1. The laser sensors detect whether a person is entering or exiting a building
2. The C++ program increments or decrements the occupancy count accordingly
3. The LCD Display shows the real-time number of people inside of the building
